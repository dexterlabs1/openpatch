# Current work plan

Updated 2026-10-16. This is the compact execution plan; [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) and [MODULE_COVERAGE.md](MODULE_COVERAGE.md) retain the full objective and parity inventory.

## Stable release

**OpenPatch 0.2.5 build 7 stays installed.** It includes the Signal Atlas knob/socket rollout, Ferrofluid and the Studio Mixer with FX sends. PR25 merged at `ab3b2a280e9affdd55015ba5fd0a4664a32df6aa`. Do not create another release for routine development changes. User priority is macOS ARM; Linux/Windows validation can wait. MIDI/live performance remain last.

## Execution changes

The recent process duplicated feature-push/PR CI, required two full capture reviews, ran benchmarks across every platform for routine UI edits, copied large manifests into chat and fragmented related work across small releases. These consume time without a matching product benefit.

Now use one milestone branch, focused local checks, one PR CI run and one appropriate review. Default CI targets macOS ARM, with Rust build/dependency caching and cancellation of superseded runs. Full Linux/Windows validation and benchmarks are available through the manual `full_validation` input. Documentation-only changes skip application CI. The installed app is independent of CI artifacts.

## In-progress milestone: complete Stock Scope integration

Feature implementation is paused. The current branch/worktree is `work/stock-scope-integration` / `openpatch-stock-scope-integration`.

- **Proven:** the optimized actual Core probe matched all 4,242 frozen genuine-Rack snapshots across 1,056 cases, including full 50-second sweeps at three rates. The reference declaration remains unchanged. This establishes the bounded source/host numerical result, not complete application or hardware qualification.
- **Written, not yet qualified:** the shared stock panel, native AUTO view, real callback/MCP transport, seven Core lifecycle/realtime tests, panel tests and separate 46-record safety probe.
- **Known next fixes:** two new test comparisons must use `Cable.id.as_deref()` because IDs are optional; the Stock Scope TIME drag must use the current observed Session revision on successive moves, retaining opening revision only for text-entry stale-editor rejection.
- **Next verification:** check those focused targets, run the existing safety probe, verify actual Callback → Session inspection and affected stock panel interactions, then one complete macOS regression. Reuse the unchanged numerical evidence unless relevant production DSP changes.
- **Done:** source controls/lifecycle remain truthful; the stock panel, weak-signal AUTO, cable interactions and live inspection work together; affected focused tests and one macOS regression pass. Then review one milestone PR. Package/install only at a useful release milestone, with the user's session preserved.

The authoritative local evidence is `native-test-output/stock-scope/STATE.json` in the integration worktree. Full logs/traces stay outside chat and Git. Existing `scope` and user patches keep their separate behavior.

## Course to completion

One focused Astra advisory reviewed the remaining scope and this execution policy. Finish Scope when development resumes, then prioritize making music with real imported patches. A performance defect that prevents those patches from running takes priority immediately.

| Milestone | User-visible exit |
|---|---|
| 1. Scope integration | Connect, adjust and inspect Stock Scope reliably, including successive TIME drags, native AUTO view and real Callback → MCP publication. Focused safety/lifecycle/realtime and one Mac regression pass. |
| 2. Real Rack patch workflows | Open, repair, play, save and reopen a declared collection of actual `.vcv` patches with routing, parameters, layout and assets preserved. Unsupported modules remain explicit, recoverable placeholders. Publish the supported mapping. |
| 3. Complete non-MIDI Mac instrument | Close module gaps in coherent families, including hidden VCA-2/Unity compatibility; complete editing/history, project recovery, audio configuration and Audio 2/8/16 requirements. Qualify shared physical audio paths once at the host milestone. |
| 4. Demonstrated performance/reliability | Comparable representative small, polyphonic, feedback, delay-heavy and large patch measurements support specific CPU/latency claims. Fix measured bottlenecks; verify callback deadlines, live graph changes, overload, installation/upgrade and recovery. |
| 5. Distinctive creative workflow | MCP completes useful musical editing/project tasks with visible changes, coherent undo and conflict recovery; GLSL visuals persist assets and contain failures during audio use. General-purpose live DSP authoring stays a separate later feature. |
| 6. Deferred portability, then MIDI/live | When authorized, qualify Linux/Windows against the finished baseline. Complete remaining MIDI conversion, mapping, timing, reconnect and stuck-note recovery last. These gates remain open until actually verified. |

Keep frozen numerical contracts, state/event and realtime invariants, persistence/migration, representative native interactions and actual device qualification. Add cases for concrete uncovered behavior; do not multiply every parameter, platform, sample rate and gesture into an exhaustive Cartesian matrix. Numerical agreement alone is not application completion.

The immediate architecture decision is the [compatibility boundary](COMPATIBILITY_DECISION.md): stable native module identities, versioned state and recoverable source payloads are shared foundations for import and extensions. Existing VCV binary hosting is a distinct unresolved deliverable; a Rust extension API does not silently satisfy it.

The final goal still requires the pinned 49-module baseline, tracked legacy compatibility, the host matrix, supported platforms and bounded improvement claims. Until deferred requirements pass, call intermediate releases macOS/non-MIDI milestones, not full Rack parity. Third-party coverage is a versioned support matrix, not an unfinishable promise to support every future plugin.
